# Multi-threaded-segmented-memory-allocator
 Assignment 2 for Operating Systems Principles
 
Another C++ project i undertook was implementing a multi-threaded segmented memory allocator for my latest Operating Systems Principles class which i recently undertook. This project helped me understand

- How the malloc function in C works (contiguous memory allocation, memory management techniques, freeing memory techniques and allocation techniques) 
- How threads work and the law of diminishing returns (amdahl's law).
- Debugging multi-threaded programs (horrific)
